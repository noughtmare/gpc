category:        Parsing
description:
    Gigaparsec (Gpc) is a library providing generalized parser combinators (Gpc)
    which are able to parse all context-free grammars completely. This includes
    support for left-recursion and reporting all possible parses of ambiguous
    grammars.

    Gigaparsec is currently only a proof of concept. Of course it needs a much more
    elaborate API, but before that I want to implement disambiguation strategies.
    I have also not put any effort in making this library performant yet.
tested-with:     GHC ==9.2.7
